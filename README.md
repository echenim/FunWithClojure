# fun with clojure

Today 24/10/2018, we will start with a  series fun with clojure
the goal to using clojure to explore the world of mathematical algorithm
the goal to getting to know Clojure intimately
we find out what makes Clojure tick

We  will explore verious mathematical artifacts like :
# Recursion : functions that call itself
# Fibonicci series 
# Eular identity
# Zeta function
We will try to calculate the Zeta function
we try to find the relationship between its zeros and the distribution of the prime numbers using the zeta function
